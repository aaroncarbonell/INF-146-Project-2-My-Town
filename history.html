<div id="hist2">
	<h2>Revolutionary War</h2>

	<p>In 1776, the first poeple to have lived in Fort Lee were the Lenni Lenape Indians. After Captain Henry Hudson recorded reference of it in 1609, Stephen Bourdette purchased 400 acres of it along the known town of present-day Edgewater in 1756. Bourdette's home was the only stone house within the mile radius and later became to serve as  General George Washington's headquaters during the American Revolution.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Originally named Fort Constitution but later named after Major General Charles Lee (February 6, 1732 - October 2, 1782); Fort Lee is the sister garrison of Fort Washington.</li>
		<li>The Battle of Fort Lee (appr. Nov 19, 1776 - Nov 20, 1776) was an American loss to British general, Charles Lord Cornwallis who led 5,000 soilders to invade the fort that had already been evacuated by orders of American Patriot Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Greene. 2,000 American soldiers retreated to Hackensack where George Washington awaited them. When the British arrived, they were found with 50 cannons, 1,000 barrels of flower, barrels of ammunition, and plenty of other supplies left by the fleeting Revolutuionaries. Twelve drunken Americans soldiers were captured along with 150 other prisoners.</li>
		<li>No deaths or injuries were reported.</li>

	<h2>Mini-NY</h2>

	<p>Given its close location and rich history, Fort Lee is considered to be urban/suburban mimic of New York City. With its range of diverse cultures, busy streets into the late night, and  modern architecture, this city is but a carbon copy of its neighbor across the Hudson River.
